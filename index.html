                <p>I was born in Queretaro, Mexico where I enjoyed part of my childhood until the age of 9. My family moved to Austin, TX and have resided here since. I attended St. Edward's University where I majored in Accounting and Information Technology. I chose the AIT major after determining that I wanted to learn about business and saw myself working in Accounting. St. Edward's requires for all students to take a course about Computer Science and I got hooked, I wanted to learn it more as a hobby because I had grown with out using much Technology. I graduated from St. Edward's University in 2014 after taking a short break because of scheduling issues.</p>
                <p>After graduating, I began working for A-A-A Natural Stone a start up company set up by my husband to re-sale limestone. It was soon acquired by Simpson Stone the Company where he managed a stone quarry and A-A-A became the front company. When I started working at A-A-A Natural Stone I began by creating the company website. Soon I found myself also working on all advertising functions of the company and continued to work where I was most needed. Because it was a small company I had that freedom.Eventually the company grew to a competitive size and I began to realize that even thought the company was growing I had forgotten about my persuit to practice Accounting.</p>
                <p>I began to work for Kristy R. Cortez CPA firm to learn more and practice what I had learned about Accounting. I only worked for a few months at the firm after my husband and I decided to take a chance and go on our own business venture.</p> <p>We started our own company <a href="https://valet.storage/"> Valet Storage</a> and in order to continue learning and be a better asset to our I decided to go back to school and sharpen my skills in programming by entering a coding bootcamp.</p>
                <p>My hobbies include running, reading, and eating. In the last month my husband and I started our own business venture.</p>
